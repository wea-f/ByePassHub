### Skiovox | Unrestricted CHROME (MUST USE)
Follow the instructions found from [here](https://chrose.netlify.app/detail/skiovox/)<br>
Use a unblocker if needed. <br>
This requires you to shutdown your chromebook, so open those links on another device or just write down the instructions on a piece of paper. <br>
If you are confused on the directions, here are some tips from my experience doing this: <br>
- Make sure to press alt shift s, NOT ctrl shift s or something else
- Make sure to COMPLETELY wait for the "Network Available" Screen on step 1.4
- Make sure to install the Skiovox Helper extension from Stage 3 by scrolling down further. 
- When configuring our browser shortcuts, press the buttons on your keyboard to execute the shortcut, don't type it out like ctrl shift s, actually do it.

### TerraOS | Boot a unrestricted operating system from an RMA shim
1. Clone the [TerraOS](https://github.com/r58Playz/terraos) repository. This is done by running this in a terminal:
```js
git clone https://github.com/r58Playz/terraos.git
```
2. Create a build directory in the cloned directory.
3. Run this in the terminal
```js
bash ../scripts/build_stage1.sh <defconfig>
```
 - Use terraos as the defconfig if building for x86_64 Chromebooks.
 - Use terraos_jacuzzi as the defconfig if building for jacuzzi board Chromebooks.
 - Support for jacuzzi boards is experimental and may not work.
4. Run this in the terminal:
```js
bash ../scripts/build_aur_packages.sh
```
5. Run `bash ../scripts/build_all.sh <shim.bin> <board_recovery.bin> <reven_recovery.bin>` in the terminal, replacing<br>
`<shim.bin>` with the path to a shim for your board, <br>
`<board_recovery.bin>` with the path to a recovery image for your board, <br>
and `<reven_recovery.bin>` with the path to a Chrome OS Flex recovery of the same version. <br>
This places a built bootloader image, SquashFS and tarballs of the arch RootFS, a bootloader image with the arch Rootfs, a bootloader image with TerraOS Chrome OS, and a bootloader image with both the arch RootFS and TerraOS Chrome OS in the build directory.
<br>
The default arch RootFS user and password are `terraos.`

**FEATURES:** 
- Run a full Debian installation on a Chromebook
- Does not modify the firmware
- Works on enterprise enrolled devices
- Can boot Chrome OS with no restrictions (useful for enrolled devices)
- Nearly full device compatibility
- Optional disk compression
- Multiple desktop environments supported (gnome, xfce, kde, lxde, gnome-flashback, cinnamon, mate, and lxqt) <br>

**Requirements:**
- A separate Linux PC for the build process (preferably something Debian-based)
- WSL2 is supported if you are on Windows
- A USB drive that is at least 8GB in size
- Cheap USB 2.0 drives typically won't work well due to their slow speeds
- At least 20GB of free disk space on Host PC
