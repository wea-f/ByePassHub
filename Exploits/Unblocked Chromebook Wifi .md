It's a tutorial to open **another wifi** then the one imposed onto you by your chromebook manager with policies.
Preferably, you should open a wifi without DNS blocking, such as the guest wifi, like me.
Unfortunately, you need to know the password to the wifi you want to connect to, or hope the guest wifi password is free.
